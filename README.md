## Lessons Learned
By completing this project, I was able to get comfortable with the basics of React and its ecosystem. I also experienced the convenience of Vite's lightweight build process which saved me time setting up my environment and made me more productive. Some key takeaways for me were:

- How to modularize my React code into reusable and maintainable components
- When and how to use state and prop, and when to lift them up
- Choosing the right structure for my state
- Comfortably using JSX to dynamically render elements
- The power of React's components for building reusable user interfaces
